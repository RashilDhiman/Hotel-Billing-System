# Hotel Billing System (HBS) - Android App

## Overview
**Hotel Billing System (HBS)** is an Android application built with **Kotlin** and **Firebase** to manage hotel operations such as customer management, branch management, billing, and invoicing. The system is designed for hotel staff and administrators to streamline daily operations and automate billing, making it easier to manage customers, track orders, and generate invoices efficiently.

The app provides a user-friendly interface and a clean workflow, allowing hotel staff to focus on providing services while the system handles billing and record-keeping.

- **Branch Management**: Manage multiple hotel branches.  
- **Billing**: Generate and save bills for hotel services or products.

  - Manage hotel branches (`ManageBranchesActivity` and `AddBranchActivity`).
  - View all registered customers (`CustomerListActivity`).
  - Generate bills and invoices for services (`BillActivity` and `InvoiceActivity`).

### 3. **Customer Management**
- Staff can add new customers (`AddCustomerActivity`) with details like:
  - Name
  - Phone
  - Email
  - Address
- All customer data is stored in Firebase Firestore under a `customers` collection.
- Customers can be listed and managed through `CustomerListActivity`.

### 4. **Branch Management**
- Admin can add or edit hotel branches.
- Branch data includes branch name, location, and other relevant information.
- Each branch is stored in Firestore under a `branches` collection.

### 5. **Billing**

- Bills can include items/services, prices, and taxes.
- All billing records are stored in Firestore for auditing and reporting.

### 6. **Invoice Management**
